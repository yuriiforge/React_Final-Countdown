# ⏳ Final Countdown

## 📄 Description

The **Final Countdown** is a React.js application that challenges your timing skills!  
Set a target time, start the countdown, and try to stop the timer as close to zero as possible.

This project focuses on **timing logic** and advanced React features, including:

- ⏱ Managing timers with **`setInterval`** and **`clearInterval`**.
- 📌 Persisting references with **`useRef`** for performance and control.
- 🌀 Creating and cleaning up **intervals** correctly to avoid memory leaks.
- 🪟 Using **React Portals** to render modals outside the main DOM hierarchy.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Precision challenge** – stop the timer exactly at zero.
- ⏲ **Custom target time** – choose your countdown duration.
- 🔔 **Game results modal** – displayed via a React Portal.
- 🛡 **Clean interval management** – ensures no runaway timers.
